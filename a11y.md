# WCAG

1. Perceivable: Can the user see it?
2. Operable: Can the user operate the UI and navigate content?
3. Understandable: Can the user understand the interface?
4. Robust: How accessible across devices?

# Focus

-   Generally only interactive elements should have focus
-   Arrange elements in the dom to have a natural focus order rather than managing focus with `focusindex`

## Manage focus in a SPA

-   A navigation tab that routes the page or scrolls should upon click transfer focus to a header element
    -   Pseudocode: <nav><button>Go</button></nav>fuuuu<h2 tabindex="-1" focusOnMe>Go</h2> Note: The element is removed from tab navigation map
