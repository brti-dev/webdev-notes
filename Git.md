# Git

'commit': snapshot of a project
'fork': use an existing project as a starting point for your own
'clone': downloads your fork onto local machine
'remote': a repository stored on another computer (GitHub's server).
 - It is standard practice (and also the default when you clone a repository) to give the name `origin` to the remote that points to your main offsite repository (for example, your GitHub repository).
'branch': the way to work on different parts of a repository at one time; a lightweight movable pointer to a commit
 - ie keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from the `master` (default/production) branch
 - branches later merged into `master` after changes/commits/discussion
 - creating a branch merely creates that branch; the current working (`HEAD`) branch is still `master` (or whatever branch you are currently working from) (switch branches with the $ git checkout <branch> command)
'tracked': file in a previous commit that Git knows about
'Modified': you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet
'Committed': the data is safely stored in your local database
'Staged': you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot

## Basic work flow

  $ git add foo.txt      // tree -> stage
  $ git commit           //         stage -> history
  $ git reset foo.txt    //         stage <- history // $ git reset --soft HEAD~1 to restage everything but keep changes
  $ git checkout foo.txt // tree <- stage
  $ git checkout HEAD    // tree <---------- history

  $ git diff             // tree >< stage            // changed since the last checkpoint but not staged
  $ git diff --staged    //         stage >< history // compare staged changes to last commit
  $ git diff HEAD~1      // tree ><          history // changed since the last commit

`git checkout .` reverts to the last checkpoint
`git checkout head .` reverts to the last commit
`git stash` and `git checkout -m -b` operate on the changes since the last commit

## Commands

$ git config --global color.ui auto // Enables helpful colorization of command line output
             --global user.email "[email address]" // Sets the email you want attached to your commit transactions
             --global user.name "[name]" // Sets the name you want attached to your commit transactions
             --global credential.helper cache // don't keep typing password; more: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Credential-Storage

$ git init //Turn an existing directory into a git repository
           --bare //Create a repository that will be used for collaboration
      clone [url]

$ git branch <BRANCHNAME> //create new branch //ie $ git branch cleanup //then: git checkout cleanup
             -d <BRANCHNAME> //delete branch
             -v //view the last commit on each branch
             --merged //Branches on this list without the * in front of them are generally fine to delete; 
                      //youâ€™ve already incorporated their work into another branch
             -m <OLDBRANCHNAME> <NEWBRANCHNAME>
      checkout //Checkout a branch or paths to the working tree
               -b //Create & checkout = $ git branch <branchname> && git checkout <branchname>
               -- <FILES> //throw away local changes
      merge <BRANCHNAME> //ie > git merge cleanup
            --abort // If there are conflicts
      mergetool //GUI for solving merge conflicts

$ git fetch //Downloads all history from the remote tracking branches
      pull //= $ git fetch + $ git merge
      push
      merge // Combines remote tracking branch into current local branch

$ git log //Lists version history for the current branch
          --follow [file] //Lists version history for a file, including renames
          -p [-<NUMTOSHOW>]//diff (details)
          --oneline
      commit //Records file snapshots permanently in version history
             -v //output diff details in editor
             -m "<DESCRIPTION>" //commit message; add `[ci skip]` to the description to skip Travis Ci build
             -a //automatically commit all tracked files (need not be staged) //ie $ git commit -a -m "added new benchmarks"
             --amend //take everything staged and amend it to last commit; or if nothing staged just amend the commit message
             --no-edit //Don't edit commit message on amend
      add <FILENAMES> //stage files into a snapshot in preparation for versioning
          -u //Stages only Modified Files
          . //Stages everything, without Deleted Files
      show [commit]// Outputs metadata and content changes of the specified commit 
      diff [first-branch]...[second-branch] //Shows content differences between two branches

$ git reset [commit] //Undoes all commits after [commit], preserving changes locally
            --hard [commit] //Discards all history and changes back to the specified commit
            --hard HEAD~1 //undo commit & restore everything in the working dir
            HEAD <FILENAME> //unstage a file
            --soft HEAD~1 //restage everything but keep changes

$ git remote
             -v //verbose
             add <SHORTNAME> <URL> //ie > git remote add origin https://github.com/try-git/try_git.git
             set-url <REMOTENAME> <URL> //Edit remote URL

## .gitignore

` # a comment - this is ignored
  # no .a files
  *.a
  # but do track lib.a, even though you're ignoring .a files above
  !lib.a
  # only ignore the root TODO file, not subdir/TODO
  /TODO
  # ignore all files in the build/ directory
  build/
  # ignore doc/notes.txt, but not doc/server/arch.txt
  doc/*.txt
  # ignore all .txt files in the doc/ directory & children
  doc/**/*.txt
  # ignore all files ending in .o or .a
  *.[oa]
  # all files ending in a tilde
  *~
  # ? for single char
  f?o.txt`

## Working with branches
  $ git branch testing // or $ git checkout -b testing
At this point, HEAD is still pointing to `master` which can be confirmed:
  $ git log --oneline --decorate
Switch to the new branch:
  $ git checkout testing
Make some changes... then commit: (EVERYTHING STAGED WILL BE COMMITTED!)
  $ git commit -a -m 'made a change'
HEAD and `testing` now move forward, though `master` still points to the previous commit
Add `--all` to the `git log` command to see all the branches
  $ git log --oneline --decorate --all
Move HEAD back to the `master` branch; This also _reverts files back to that snapshot_
  $ git checkout master
Merge changes:
  $ git merge testing
Delete the branch since we're done with it:
  $ git branch -d testing
If at the merge there was a conflict, resolve it by making changes to the file, or use `mergetool`, or abort the merge:
  $ git mergetool
  $ git merge --abort
After fixing conflicts:
  $ git commit

## Fetching from remote
Download remote branches
  $ git fetch origin
See what commits have been added upstream
  $ git log --oneline master..origin/master
Approve the changes and merge them into your local master branch with the following commands:
  $ git checkout master
  $ git log origin/master
Merge
  $ git merge origin/master

## SSH
  $ eval `ssh-agent -s`
  $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa // input password to save session

## Tricks

### Delete a file from local repository but not remote
1. Add all the files, individually or in a folder, that you want to remove from the repo but keep locally to .gitignore.
2. Execute git rm --cached put/here/your/file.ext for each file or git rm --cached folder/\* if they are in a folder. (It is /\* because you need to escape the *)
3. Commit your changes.
4. Push to remote.

### Replace local changes
In case you did something wrong you can replace local changes using the command
  $ git checkout -- <filename>
...this replaces the changes in your working tree with the last content in HEAD. Changes already added to the index, as well as new files, will be kept.
If you instead want to drop all your local changes and commits, fetch the latest history from the server and point your local master branch at it like this
  $ git fetch origin
  $ git reset --hard origin/master

### Choose certain hunks interactively
  $ git add -p
  $ git checkout -p //from the last commit
  $ git reset -p //choose certain

### Ammend something to the last commit
  $ git commit -m 'initial commit'
  $ git add forgotten_file
  $ git commit --amend
or force the amended commit (this can cause conflicts if someone else pulls the commit in the meantime!)
  $ git commit --amend --no-edit
  $ git push -f
