## About

- A library, not a framework
    - Not opinionated
    - No required patterns like MVC
- Declarative rather than imperative
    - Declares how the view looks given data --> builds a virtual representation of the view in memory --> handles changes automatically
- Component-based
    - Encapsulation of information
    - Loose-coupling between different components
- No Templates
    - Use JSX markup to create nested DOM elements
- Isomorphic
    - Same code on browser and server
